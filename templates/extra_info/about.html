    <p class="text-align-center"><em>"The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough. They’re there to stop the other people."</em>&emsp;- Randy Pausch</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The goal of CharityFitness is to provide you an easy method of staying on track to meet your personal health goals. If you do happen to miss your goals we give you the oppuritunity to donate to a charity called Save the Children. We specifically chose Save the Children for one main reason - efficiency. Save the Children donates <strong>87%</strong> on its programs as opposed to the American Cancer society which spent about 59.9% in 2014 according to <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=6495">charitynavigator.org</a>. Save the Children has reached 185 million children in 120 countries all over the world. The organization helps in many areas such as nutrition, health, education, and childhood development. We also provide basic information on how to better your personal health with regards to diet and exercise.</p>
    <p>Not only will you see an improvement in physical comfort but also in your mental well-being. You will see an enhancement of your self-esteem and confidence in the long-run. In the short-run exercising can provide somewhat of an unspoken emotional catharsis. If going through a stressful situation then go for a run. </p>
	<p>Additionaly, knowing <em>why</em> you want to do something is even more important than knowing <em>how</em> to do it. Was there some sort of traumatizing moment that spurred you into action? If so, constantly ask yourself if the pain and struggle you must endure to reach your goal is comparable to the pain of the emotional hardship that spurred you into action in the first place. Remind yourself <em>why</em> you got started in the first place and don't forget.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Keeping track of your progress using photos is actually far better than just tracking your weight, despite the message you may infer from the design of your profile page. Whether you're attempting to gain weight or lose it, your visual improvement will have a much more powerful effect on your psyche.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The difficulty of improving your health will vary depending on how quickly you wish to see  sunstantial results. If you are attempting to rapidly improve your health it will require somewhat of a drastic change in your personal lifestyle. If you are more interested in the long-term benefits of improving your health then change can come incrementally. Regardless of which path you choose, you will need dedication. It can be hard to maintain the same level of motivation over a long period of time. Your willpower will be tested which is why it is important you remember <em>why</em> you got started in the first place. That being said, we wish you the best of luck on your journey moving forward.</p>
